# Xmonad + Gnome

This is a script to install xmonad with Gnome session manager in Ubuntu since [gnome-session-xmonad](https://github.com/Gekkio/gnome-session-xmonad) is no longer supported.

This is basically untested. It might work. Use at your own risk. It's up here for my own reference.

Ubuntu version: 22.04 jammy
